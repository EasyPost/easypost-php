=== 2.1.0 2015-04-10

* Added User and CarrierAccount resources and examples for each.
* Modified EasyPost Object setter to record the change in the top level parent
object rather than the object that the change was made in. This allows you to
change sub objects and then call save() on the parent to have all properties
saved.
* Removed EasyPost Object transientValues and made unsavedValues act as a 
representation of the params to send on save, rather than a flag to indicate
if a property had been changed.
* Added support for EasyPost's new error format: {"error": {"message": "...",
"code": ..., "errors": {...}}} as well as a prettyPrint function to better
display errors in development.
* Added support for additional HTTP methods PATCH and PUT.
* EasyPost Objects are now Iterable.
