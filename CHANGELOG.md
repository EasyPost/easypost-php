Upgrading major versions of this project? Refer to the [Upgrade Guide](UPGRADE_GUIDE.md).

- Drops support for PHP 7.4
- Adds support for PHP 8.3
- Persists the HTTP client inside of the `EasyPostClient` via the `httpClient` property to reduce memory consumption on consecutive requests
- Adds type declarations for parameters and return values throughout the library, corrects docstrings to match
- Removed `withCarbonOffset` parameter from `create`, `buy`, and `regenerateRates` functions of the Shipment service as EasyPost now offers Carbon Neutral shipments by default for free
- Fixes a bug where the original filtering criteria of `all` calls wasn't passed along to `getNextPage` calls. Now, these are persisted via a `_params` key on response objects locally
- Removes the undocumented `createAndBuy` function from the `Batch` service. The proper usage is to create a batch first and buy it separately
- Renames `primaryOrSecondary` to `priority` to match the API name for the parameter
- Corrects the order of the `userId` and `email` parameters in the `updateEmail` function of the ReferralCustomer service to match the rest of the library where IDs are always the first parameter
- Fix various bugs throughout the library

Upgrading major versions of this project? Refer to the [Upgrade Guide](UPGRADE_GUIDE.md).

- Release final version of v6 that contains all the changes in the `v6.0.0-rc1` below

## v6.0.0-rc1 (2022-12-15)

- PHP 7.3 is no longer supported
- Added a new `EasyPostClient` object which encapsulates the API key. All functions are called against this client allowing for thread-safety (eg: `$client->shipment->create()`)
  - All instance methods and the ability to have objects update in-place has been removed due to this rearchitecture. When updating objects or performing actions on them (eg: creating a label/scanform), you will need to assign the return value to a variable and use that moving forward instead of relying on the object getting updated without capturing the new return value
  - `->save()` instance methods are now `update()` static methods
  - Functions no longer accept an API key as an optional parameter
  - EasyPost objects no longer contain the logic associated with them; instead, we have `Services` for each EasyPost object. All the services are properties of an `EasyPostClient`. You can then call functions on a Service.
- All function and parameter names are now camelCase. Previously we used a mix of camel and snake cases
- Improves error exception handling (closes #7)
  - Introduced ~2 dozen new exception types that extend from either `ApiException` or `EasyPostException`
  - ApiExceptions will behave like the previous EasyPostException class did. They will include a `message`, `errors`, `code`, `httpStatus` and `httpBody`. This class extends the more generic EasyPostException which only contains a message, used for exceptions thrown directly from this library
  - The `ecode` property of an `ApiException` is now just `code`
- Functions that previously returned `true` now return void as there is no response body from the API (eg: `fundWallet`, `deletePaymentMethod`, `updateEmail`, `createList`)
- Adopts `Guzzle` as the HTTP client for this library. This should provide a much more consistent experience, better encoding, and faster request times in some cases
- The results of calling `allApiKeys` is no longer double wrapped with the mode of the API key (these are still accessible inside of each object)
- `Requestor` has moved to `Http`, constants from `EasyPost` now live in `Constants`, `Error` moved to `Exception`
- Occurances of `smartrate` are now `smartRate` and `Smartrate` are now `SmartRate` to match the documentation and API expectations
- `Referral` is now `ReferralCustomer` to better match documentation and API expectation
- `validateWebhook`, `getLowestSmartRate`, and `receiveEvent` are now under `EasyPost\Util\Util` as they do not make any API calls and do not need the associated client object
  - The `receive` function previously in the namespace of `Event` is now called `receiveEvent` since it has been relocated to the generic Util namespace
  - Internal, library only utilities have been moved to `EasyPost\Util\InternalUtil`
- The beta `EndShipper` class has been removed, please use the generally available `EndShipper` class
- Various properties and functions that were previously intended for private/protected use but were public have been corrected
- All phpdoc type hints, descriptions, return values, and throws references were corrected or updated
- All dependencies were bumped
- Various other bug fixes and improvements were made along with addressing deprecation warnings

## v5.8.0 (2022-12-01)

- Adds carrier account creation routes requests correctly for carriers that require custom workflows
- Instead of returning `null` when a list of child API keys cannot be returned (eg: when you call `api_keys` on a non-user object) it will return an empty list. The expected impact to end users is extremely low
- Retrieving child user API keys for users with large numbers of child users should see much faster results as we now break on the match instead of iterating the entire list

## v5.7.0 (2022-09-21)

- Adds Partner White Label (Referral) Support
  - Adds ability to create a referral user
  - Adds ability to update a referral user's email
  - Adds ability to retrieve all referral users
  - Adds ability to add a credit card to a referral user's account
- Adds support to specify an `$endShipperId` on the buy call of a Shipment
- Removes unreachable code in the address verification flow that checked for the existence of an address (errors will continue to be thrown on failure)

## v5.6.0 (2022-08-25)

- Moves EndShipper out of beta into the general library namespace

## v5.5.1 (2022-08-20)

- Removes some extra imports that no longer exist causing errors when importing this library. Adds a regression test to protect against this in the future.

## v5.5.0 (2022-08-02)

- Adds Carbon Offset support
  - Adds ability to create a shipment with carbon offset
  - Adds ability to buy a shipment with carbon offset
  - Adds ability to one-call-buy a shipment with carbon offset
  - Adds ability to rerate a shipment with carbon offset
- Adds `validateWebhook` function that returns your webhook or raises an error if there is a `webhookSecret` mismatch
- Fixes a bug that required the values of `verify` and `verify_strict` params on an Address creation call to be arrays since passing `true` as a boolean is also valid (passing an array will continue to work but is no longer required)

## v5.4.0 (2022-07-18)

- Add ability to generate forms for shipments via `generate_form()` function

## v5.3.0 (2022-07-07)

- Adds `Billing::retrieve_payment_methods()`, `Billing::fund_wallet()`, and `Billing::delete_payment_method()` functions
- Adds OS specific details to the `User-Agent` header
- Applies a patch to coerce array error messages to strings where error mapping is done improperly (as is the case with carriers like GSO/GLS) (closes #181)

## v5.2.1 (2022-05-31)

- Fixes a missing parameter bug by setting the `beta` parameter in the `refresh` function to `false` by default

## v5.2.0 (2022-05-19)

- Adds the `EndShipper` Beta class with `create`, `retrieve`, `all`, and `save` functions

## v5.1.1 (2022-05-09)

- Adds present but unimported supplemental EasyPost object classes such as `TrackingDetails` to the lib (closes #164)

## v5.1.0 (2022-05-09)

- Adds a `lowest_rate()` function to Orders and Pickups
- Adds `Shipment::get_lowest_smartrate()` and `$shipment.lowest_smartrate()` functions
- Removes the `params` from the `Address->verify()` method since it's non-static and unused
- Removes dead conditional `message` check in `Address::create_and_verify`

## v5.0.0 (2022-02-09)

Upgrading major versions of this project? Refer to the [Upgrade Guide](UPGRADE_GUIDE.md).

- Removed unusable `all()` method on the `Parcel` object
- Removed unpaginated `all()` method on the `Order`, `CustomsInfo`, and `CustomsItem` objects
- Removed the `get_rates()` method on the Shipment object since a Shipment object already has rates. If you need new rates for a shipment, use the `regenerate_rates()` method instead

- Various other small improvements and bug fixes
